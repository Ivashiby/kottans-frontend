##Git та GitHub
____
1. I attended two weeks of the Introduction to Git and GitHub course on Coursera. Most of the information was new to me. It was difficult to learn course in English, but I didn't turn on subtitles, because the built-in translator often changes the content of the information with its translation.
2. Completed some levels on learngitbranching.js.org It was very interesting. And the fact that most of the tasks were for practice helped to better understand the working principle of Git. I will continue to solve exercises here.
